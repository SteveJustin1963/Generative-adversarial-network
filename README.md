# Generative-adversarial-network
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks, pitting one against the other (thus the “adversarial”) in order to generate new, synthetic instances of data that can pass for real data. They are used widely in image generation, video generation and voice generation... is a machine learning (ML) model in which two neural networks compete with each other to become more accurate in their predictions. GANs typically run unsupervised and use a cooperative zero-sum game framework to learn...GAN model is Faster than CNN. This model is more Realistic in operation. Another advantage is it does not need more pre-processing. But this model has time and space complexity than other models like CNN, RNN... are an exciting recent innovation in machine learning. GANs are generative models: they create new data instances that resemble your training data. For example, GANs can create images that look like photographs of human faces, even though the faces don't belong to any real person....applications are able to solve different tasks: Text-to-Image Translation. Semantic-Image-to-Photo Translation. Face Frontal View Generation. Generate New Human Poses...are unsupervised learning algorithms that use a supervised loss as part of the training...are a deep-learning-based generative model. More generally, GANs are a model architecture for training a generative model, and it is most common to use deep learning models in this architecture....are a data augmentation technique that produce NEW data samples. GANs take random noise from a latent space and produce unique images that mimic the feature distribution of the original dataset...main goal of GANs is to learn from a set of training data and generate new data with the same characteristics as the training data. It is composed of two neural network models, a generator and a discriminator...
